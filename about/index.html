        <h3> Hometown </h3>
        <p> Born and raised on the southside of Chicago, Illinois. I lived in the
            Back of the Yards neighborhood until the age of 10. My family
            relocated to the Garfield Ridge area, also referred to as Midway. I
            still live there to this day. Chicago is all I know, but I plan
            to travel away from my home roots upon graduation in 2019!</p>

        <h3> Sports Teams </h3>
        <p> I wholeheartedly believe that an individual cannot be both a Sox fan
            and Cubs fan. The whole point of living in this city is picking a
            team to keep the rivalry alive. Therefore, Sox pride all the way!
            I'm also a Bears fan, a Bulls fan, and a Blackhawks fan. Did I
            mention I have worked for a security company who was hired for
            Bears games, Sox games, and Cubs games? Yes, it was awesome- even
            when I worked the Cubs games because I got to live-up the cross-town
            rivalry.</p>

        <h3> Astrology </h3>
        <p> I was born on September 28th, so my zodiac sign is the Libra;
            however, my moon is a Virgo due to the time I was born (early a.m.)!
            The symbol for Libra is the scales. Therefore, I am always looking
            at both sides of the spectrum. Disclaimer: I do not think that
            everything in your life happens as a result of your zodiac sign, but
            I do believe some characteristics apply to individuals depending on
            when they were born.</p>
